# Predicting Mouse Pupil Size from Neuronal Response

This project was developed as part of the TReND-CaMinA 2025 summer school to use neural recordings to predict pupil size in mice using machine learning techniques.

## üéØ Objective

To predict pupil size (regression) and classify pupil state (normal, constricted, dilated) from neuronal response data, and evaluate model performance.

## üß™ Methods Explored

We implemented and compared three different models:

- **Linear Regression** ‚Üí R¬≤ ‚âà 22.2%
- **MLP Regressor** ‚Üí R¬≤ ‚âà 59.6%
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** ‚Üí R¬≤ ‚âà 75.0%

## üìä Results

- Best performance achieved by DNN: **R¬≤ = 0.75, RMSE ‚âà 3.82%**
- All models used interpolated, preprocessed neural recordings
- The dataset is from the **Allen Brain Observatory**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Applications

- Neurological disorder detection (e.g. Parkinson‚Äôs, Alzheimer‚Äôs, ADHD)
- Mental effort and cognitive load tracking
- Emotion and arousal monitoring
- Adaptive interfaces and assistive tech

## üì¶ Dependencies

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìÅ Files

- `pupil_prediction_three_models.ipynb` ‚Äì main notebook covering all models
